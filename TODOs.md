I'm a senior full stack developer and developing a rental app like airbnb with some unique ideas. System architecture is very simple microservice architecture using aws api gateway. Frontend is being developed using nextjs and run at localhost:3000 and Auth microservice is also developed using DRF and runs at localhost:8000.

Build a listing microservice for properties listing using fastapi and postgresql database with following functionality and api endpoints:
1. CRUD operation for property listing
2. List properties with pagination
3. List featured properties
4. List safety certified properties
5. 

## Todos for property listing service:
- [x] List properties (public)
- [x] Property details (public)
- [] Get experiences
- [] Get coupons

- [] Get reviews for host
